# pandas_txt2pdf
Python pandas app that converts the text files in /txt folder (/txt/*.txt) into .pdf file formats (Snakes.pdf, Foxes.pdf, Dogs.pdf, Cats.pdf).

I made an effort to add a twist on one of my projects in my Udemy course, The Python Mega Course: Learn Python in 50 Days with 20 Apps (formerly The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications) under Ardit Sulce by adding definitions of the animals and converting the text files to pdf files.
